Hello!
I would like to publish my app on the MrServer Apps Repository.

Here's the app metadata:
```json
{
  "name": "App Name",
  "listed": true,
  "description": "App Description",
  "logo": "image-url",
  "banner": "image-url",
  "publisher": "github-username",
}
```

I have:
<!-- replace [ ] with [x] to check the boxes -->
[ ] read the README.
[ ] read all the rules and agreed to them.
